## I-My data analysis training projects with python  
### <a href="https://github.com/Tedjoulemohermann/MES-PROJETS-PYTHON/blob/main/Projet1_analytics_Hermann.ipynb">Project 1 : Public health study with python. </a> 

<b>Situation</b>:
You are integrated into a new team of researchers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), one of the United Nations bodies   whose objective is "to help build a world free from hunger ". Your team is in charge of carrying out a large-scale study on the theme of undernutrition in the world. The problem of hunger is complex and can have multiple causes, which differ from country to country. The preliminary stage of this study will therefore be to establish a "state of the art" of the research already published, but also to carry out a statistical study intended to direct research towards particular countries, and to highlight various causes of hunger. Thus, a handful of data analysts (including you!) have been selected to lead this preliminary step.

<b>Situation</b>: 
Your agri-food business wants to expand internationally. She specializes in chicken. But for the moment, the field of possibilities is very wide: no particular country or continent has been chosen for the moment. All countries are possible! Your objective will be to help target certain countries in particular, with the aim of deepening the market study afterwards. More particularly, the ideal would be to produce "groups" of countries, more or less large, whose we know the characteristics . Initially, the strategy is rather to export the products in the new target country(ies) rather than to produce locally.
